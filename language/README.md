# ðŸ—£ language

Contains shared models such as AST nodes for representing input expressions, contexts to represent bound variables and substitutions useful for type inference algorithms. The language core also includes a lexer and paser (using the [Masala](https://github.com/masala/masala-parser) parser combinator library) for the basic expression language, along with utility functions for manipulating its models.
