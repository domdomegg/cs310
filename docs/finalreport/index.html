Science<br>University of Warwick</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">TODO: Abstract</span></p><h1 class="c7" id="h.6k9gcmunzldy"><span class="c16">Introduction</span></h1><p class="c0"><span>Types are common features of many programming languages. Generally, types are </span><span>bounds</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;on program constructs (such as variables, expressions and functions) that limit what valid values they may take and how they should be interpreted within the program, however different languages use types differently. Most type systems include primitive data types such as integers, booleans and characters as well as composite types such functions from one type to another and lists of a type.</span></p><p class="c0 c6"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Type checking is the process by which a language&rsquo;s compiler or interpreter validates that a program obeys the rules of the language&rsquo;s type system. When a violation is detected, such as providing a boolean to a function accepting an integer, a type error is raised.</span></p><p class="c0 c6"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Type checking is primarily used to catch bugs in program code, preventing unexpected behaviour. A simple example of this is function application: functions&rsquo; types specify how they can be called which ensure some pre-conditions are met, such as the arguments being of an expected type. This allows function implementers to safely assume the data is of that type, and prevents function users calling the function with invalid arguments.</span></p><p class="c0 c6"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Type checking can happen either at compile time (static type checking) or runtime (dynamic type checking).</span></p><p class="c0 c6"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span>Compile-time type checking prevents many type errors from occurring at runtime. This is particularly useful when code paths may not be well tested or frequently used, as runtime checks only surface type errors when the problematic code is executed. Additionally, knowing types at compile-time allows for better tooling that improves developer productivity. For example, IDEs may use type information to suggest and perform automated refactorings (</span><sup><a href="#ftnt1" id="ftnt_ref1">[1]</a></sup><span>), automatically generate documentation (</span><sup><a href="#ftnt2" id="ftnt_ref2">[2]</a></sup><span>) and autocomplete statements (</span><sup><a href="#ftnt3" id="ftnt_ref3">[3]</a></sup><span class="c2">).</span></p><p class="c0 c6"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Compile-time type checking requires the program code to have enough information to validate its type safety. This may be in the form of type annotations or typed variable and function declarations. However, specifying types manually can be time-consuming and potentially difficult as it is additional work for the programmer, and large composite types can be especially difficult to determine and tedious to repeatedly write.</span></p><p class="c0 c6"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">A type inference algorithm for a programming language&rsquo;s type system can determine types automatically, which improves productivity by allowing programmers to get the best of types without having to explicitly specify them. Because of this, type inference is used in many popular programming languages with expressive type systems including Haskell, Rust and TypeScript.</span></p><p class="c0 c6"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">An understanding of type inference would help computer scientists write cleaner code and debug type errors. However, few universities have core modules on type systems (although they may be touched on in programming curriculums) and there are limited easy-to-understand teaching resources on type inference. Therefore, many computer science graduates will be missing a useful understanding of how type inference actually works.</span></p><p class="c0 c6"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The goal of this project is develop a system to visualise the type inference process, with the aim of improving undergraduate students&rsquo; knowledge about it.</span></p><p class="c0 c6"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">To achieve this, we develop a teaching resource that explains how type inference algorithms work for functional languages. An interactive web application allows students to enter expressions and view the results of a type inference algorithm, along with the steps taken to get to that result. This is particularly useful in the context of modules teaching functional languages such as Haskell which perform similar type inference.</span></p><h2 class="c12" id="h.2mwaav7jkal4"><span class="c13">Related work</span></h2><p class="c0"><span class="c2">There have been previous attempts to build visualisation and teaching tools related to type systems.</span></p><p class="c0 c6"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c5"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 462.20px; height: 500.24px;"><img alt="Screenshot of results from TypeTool, taken from their paper" src="images/image15.png" style="width: 462.20px; height: 500.24px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c0 c6"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span>One example is TypeTool by </span><sup><a href="#ftnt4" id="ftnt_ref4">[4]</a></sup><span class="c2">, which visualises type inference through a web application. Users enter an expression in a custom expression language, submit a request to a server and are redirected to a page displaying an initial syntax tree, a final syntax tree and an overall substitution. By allowing users to enter their own expressions, students can explore how the systems work in different cases to gain an intuitive understanding of the concepts.</span></p><p class="c0 c6"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">TypeTool&rsquo;s authors found in teaching the University of Porto&rsquo;s functional programming course that the tool was &ldquo;especially useful for students, because it helps to understand the type systems of the most common typed functional languages&rdquo; and that &ldquo;[presenting] the basis of type inference technology [...] significantly improved the way students deal with type errors because they understand the type system.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c6"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span>However, TypeTool&rsquo;s parsing and type inference is done server-side so there is a delay between the user entering an expression and seeing the result. While short, a delay reduces the ease-of-use and may discourage users from trying many different expressions. Both delayed feedback and the lack of step-by-step explanations reduce learning quality (</span><sup><a href="#ftnt5" id="ftnt_ref5">[5]</a></sup><span>), particularly in the area of rule learning. </span><sup><a href="#ftnt6" id="ftnt_ref6">[6]</a></sup><span class="c2">&nbsp;showed that immediate explanatory feedback is most effective at learning how to apply rules in computer programming. It also lacks step-by-step explanations, and it is unclear whether it supports processing incorrectly-typed expressions.</span></p><p class="c0 c6"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">In addition, the tool is now inaccessible as the server hosting the application is no longer running and the source code has not been published.</span></p><p class="c0 c6"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span>Another tool in the area of visualising type systems was developed by </span><sup><a href="#ftnt7" id="ftnt_ref7">[7]</a></sup><span class="c2">. It is a visual functional programming system which shows types during function application for a subset of Standard ML, used to teach first year undergraduate students. However, this did not explicitly show the type inference process and as a desktop application rather than web app it is less accessible to lecturers and students. It also didn&rsquo;t support key functional language constructs such as function declarations and let bindings, and required significant explanation before using the tool to understand its output.</span></p><p class="c0 c6"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c5"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 478.20px; height: 299.47px;"><img alt="Screenshot of Yung and Michaelson&#39;s tool, taken from their paper" src="images/image3.png" style="width: 478.20px; height: 299.47px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c0 c6"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span>NiMo (</span><sup><a href="#ftnt8" id="ftnt_ref8">[8]</a></sup><span class="c2">) is a graphical programming language related to functional data processing which allows users to reason about the flow of data through a program.

However, larger expressions can become complicated and be difficult to interpret.

They noted that to develop an intuitive understanding, students would benefit from experimenting with lambda-calculus and that &ldquo;a tool that deals with all these aspects in a friendly and graphical manner incentivises [experimentation]&rdquo;. TILC was successful, with the module organisers of &lsquo;programming paradigms&rsquo; at the Universitat de Girona having a &ldquo;good experience of using this tool in the course lectures and as a downloadable tool for students&rdquo;. The authors suggested extending TILC to show types and type inference would have pedagogical value.</span></p><p class="c0 c6"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">To summarise, types aid the construction of correct programs and type checking can detect issues in programs, either at compile-time or runtime. Type inference is a method often used alongside compile-time type checking to determine types in a program, an understanding of which could benefit computer scientists in writing and debugging programs. Some solutions exist which give students a better idea about types, however they either have significant limitations or do not explicitly cover type inference. In this report, we present an interactive web application for teaching type inference.</span></p><h1 class="c7" id="h.ebjyqi73zdyo"><span class="c16">Background</span></h1><h2 class="c12" id="h.odw4vku9eizz"><span class="c13">&lambda;-calculus</span></h2><p class="c0"><span>A &lambda;-calculus is a representation of computation.

Variables may be bound or free (unbound). Here `x` is bound as it is a parameter in the function abstraction, and `y` is free as there is nothing which binds it. This can be thought of in a similar way to how variables in most imperative programming languages have a scope where they are defined or undefined.</span></p><p class="c0 c6"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span>The function abstraction mentioned is the `&lambda;x. x` part. This defines an anonymous function </span><span>which given</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;an argument (before the full stop) `x` simply returns (after the full stop) `x`, i.e. the identity function. A function to add three to an input might be written `&lambda;x. x + 3` (although many of the most fundamental &lambda;-calculi do not have such explicit notions of addition or numbers).</span></p><p class="c0 c6"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Functions may be returned by other functions, which enables functions to have the appearance of taking multiple arguments. For example `&lambda;x. (&lambda;y. x)` can be viewed as a function which takes two arguments and returns the first one, even though really it is a function taking one argument which returns a function taking another argument for a result. Here explicit brackets have been given for clarity, but they aren&rsquo;t necessary. Additionally, sometimes multiple arguments like this are written together, so `&lambda;x. (&lambda;y. x)`, `&lambda;x. &lambda;y. x` and `&lambda;xy. x` all mean the same thing.</span></p><p class="c0 c6"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Finally, the function application is actually applying the function `&lambda;x. x` to the argument `y`.

As with expressions, we can again assume a global context that binds the basics variables like `Bool` and `Int`. In Hindley&rsquo;s original paper only `-&gt;` was considered as a type function (i.e. $C = { \rightarrow }$), however here we explore several type functions that have been found useful in practice.</span></p><p class="c0 c6"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span>The type function we&rsquo;ve already been using is `-&gt;` (the </span><span class="c26">function</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;type function). It takes two types as arguments and represents a function from the first type to the second. A function from `Int` to `Bool` is represented by `(-&gt;) Bool Int` in prefix notation, although would more commonly be written infix as `Bool \rightarrow Int`.</span></p><p class="c0 c6"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The function type function (`-&gt;`) should not be confused with the function type: an expression representing a function has a function type, and that function type is the function type function applied to arguments. For example `&lambda;x. x + 3` has a function type `Int \rightarrow Int`, which is the function type function `-&gt;` applied to arguments `Int` and `Int`.</span></p><p class="c0 c6"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The list type function is also very common, which given one type argument represents a list of those types. A list of booleans might be written `List Bool` or `[] Bool` in prefix notation, although often the list type is represented by wrapping the type argument in square brackets instead like `[Bool]`.</span></p><p class="c0 c6"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span>`Maybe` is another type function commonly used in functional languages like Haskell. A `Maybe` represents the optional presence of something, similar to </span><span>Java&rsquo;s</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;`Optional` and C++&rsquo;s `std::optional`. Applied to a boolean type this may be written `Maybe Bool`, representing a wrapper around nothing or a boolean. In Java this would be represented with a generic as `Optional&lt;Boolean&gt;` and in C++ as `std::optional&lt;bool&gt;`.</span></p><p class="c0 c6"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">A similar common type function is `Either`, which takes two type arguments and represents a wrapper around either one of the types. For example, an either for a boolean or integer is written `Either Bool Int`.</span></p><p class="c0 c6"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Finally, tuples represent a defined-length sequence of elements of specific types. Tuple constructors are a set of type functions representing a cross product of their type arguments, named `,`, `,,`, `,,,` and so on for different element lengths. A 3-tuple holding a boolean, integer and integer can technically be written in prefix notation as `(,,) Bool Int Int` but instead generally tuples borrow mathematical syntax with parentheses and commas like `(Bool, Int, Int)`.</span></p><p class="c0 c6"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The set of types made from `var_t` and `app_t` are known as monotypes.

This can be thought of as the `abs` equivalent for types, written as `\forall a. \rho` where `\rho` is a polytype. This definition makes monotypes a special case of polytypes: monotypes are polytypes with zero for-all qualified type variables. We can therefore consider &lsquo;type&rsquo; to mean &lsquo;polytype&rsquo;.

This allows functions to accept different types as long as they meet certain constraints. For example the `length` function is polymorphic: it has the polytype `\forall a. [a] \rightarrow Int`, which accepts a list of any type and returns its length as an integer.

Like other languages it extends HM with additional language features, such as more expressive polymorphic types with additional constraints.

For example, there is no unifying substitution for $Int \rightarrow t0$ and $Bool \rightarrow t1$ as one is a function accepting an $Int$ and the other accepts a $Bool$.</span></p><p class="c0 c6"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">For practical purposes, in type inference algorithms we require unifying substitutions to be finite as infinite types are difficult to represent and reason about. For example `x` in `&lambda;x. x x` needs to be a function that accepts itself. Initially assuming `x` has type $t0 \rightarrow t1$ and knowing it should accept itself, it also has type $(t0 \rightarrow t1) \rightarrow t1$. It also must accept that, so has type $((t0 \rightarrow t1) \rightarrow t1) \rightarrow t1$, $(((t0 \rightarrow t1) \rightarrow t1) \rightarrow t1) \rightarrow t1$, and so on. This is an infinite type and is not allowed by HM. Note that this does not exclude functions from HM which do accept themselves, such as the identity function `id` with its finite type $\forall a. a \rightarrow a$, as long as they themselves have finite types.</span></p><p class="c0 c6"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Detecting infinite types in unification is done by checking whether the types are not equal and one of the types occurs in another. This is known as the occurs check. In the previous example `&lambda;x. x x` we might try to unify $t0 \rightarrow t1$ with $t0$. $t0$ occurs in $t0 \rightarrow t1$ so there is no finite unifying substitution (an infinite unifying substitution is ${ t0 \mapsto ((((t0 \rightarrow t1) \rightarrow t1) \rightarrow infinite t1s \dots) \rightarrow t1) }$). The occurs check failing necessarily means we have an infinite type: the type contains itself.</span></p><p class="c0 c6"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Inferring types is done in a typing context. Languages often have a global context with built-in functions and their types pre-defined, such as Haskell&rsquo;s Prelude and JavaScript&rsquo;s global objects.</span></p><p class="c0 c6"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Typing contexts can be seen as maps from variable names to their corresponding types, and are represented with the symbol $\Gamma$. For example a context with some common functions may be written $\Gamma = { not: Bool \rightarrow Bool, odd: Int \rightarrow Bool, id: \forall a. a \rightarrow a }$.</span></p><p class="c0 c6"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Constructs that bind variables like `let` and `abs` add entries to a local context for these additional bindings, used in the construct bodies. For example, in `let x = 3 in odd x` the binding $x: Int$ may be added to the context used to perform type inference on the body subexpression `odd x`. Similarly in `\x \rightarrow not x` the binding $x: t0$ may be added to the context for inferring the type of the function body `not x`. Adding a binding to the context is represented by a $+$, so given $\Gamma = { x: Bool }$ then $\Gamma + y: Int$ is ${ x: Bool, y: Int }$.</span></p><p class="c0 c6"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Applying a substitution to a context is to apply the substitution to every type in the context, or effectively every &lsquo;value&rsquo; in the key-value map. For example, applying the substitution $S = { t0 \mapsto t1, t2 \mapsto Int }$ to the context $\Gamma = { x: t0, y: t1, z: t2 }$, results in a new context $S(\Gamma) = { x: t1, y: t1, z: Int }$.</span></p><p class="c0 c6"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Some types are considered more general than others. A type $\rho_a$ is more general than a type $\rho_b$ if there exists a substitution from $\rho_a$ to $\rho_b$ whose variables are for-all quantified in $\rho_a$. This is denoted by $\sqsubseteq$, for example $\forall a. a \rightarrow a$ is more general than $Int \rightarrow Int$ by the substitution ${ a \mapsto Int }$, written $\forall a. a \rightarrow a \sqsubseteq Int \rightarrow Int$. Substitutions may (and often do) substitute quantified type variables with free type variables like $t0$ and $t1$, rather than concrete types like $Int$ and $Bool$. As an example, $\forall a \forall b. (a \rightarrow b) \rightarrow [a] \rightarrow [b] \subseteq \forall a. (a \rightarrow Bool) \rightarrow [a] \rightarrow [Bool] \subseteq (t0 \rightarrow Bool) \rightarrow [t0] \rightarrow [Bool]$, following substitutions ${ b: Bool }$ and ${ a: t0 }$.</span></p><p class="c0 c6"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">For any type $\rho \subseteq \rho$, as the substitution may be empty. A type is strictly less general ($\sqsubset$) than another if and only if the substitution is non-empty. This means a strictly less general type must have at least one fewer quantified variables as one for-all quantified variable must be substituted away.</span></p><p class="c0 c6"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">TODO: (maybe) partial order diagram of some of $\forall a \forall b.

For example, the type of `id`, $\forall a. a \rightarrow a$, can be instantiated as all of $Int \rightarrow Int$, $Bool \rightarrow Bool$, $t0 \rightarrow t0$ or even $([t0] \rightarrow (Int, Bool)) \rightarrow ([t0] \rightarrow (Int, Bool))$ and more.</span></p><p class="c0 c6"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The &lsquo;opposite&rsquo; to instantiation is generalisation, where an expression with a certain type can be considered to have a more general type, adding a for-all quantification of a variable. This is allowed where the type variable is not free in any of the types in the context. Not being free in the context means the type variable does not appear unbound anywhere except in the type being generalised itself, so it does not have any other type constraints. Being free of any type constraints, it may be any type and therefore for-all quantified.</span></p><p class="c0 c6"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span>Given a type $t0 \rightarrow t1 \rightarrow t2 \rightarrow t3$ and a context ${ x : t1, y : [t2] \rightarrow Int, z: \forall t3. t3 }$ we may generalise to $\forall t0 \forall t3. t0 \rightarrow t1 \rightarrow t2 \rightarrow t3$. $t0$ is not in any of the types in the context, and $t3$ is only found bound as a for-all quantified variable. Therefore both of these may be for-all quantified. Both $t1$ and $t2$ are free in the context, so may not be generalised. (Note we&rsquo;re disregarding our convention of using $a, b, c, \dots$ </span><span>for for</span><span class="c2">-all quantified variables here, to be strict to the typing rules. Renaming the type variables with &alpha;-conversions could be done after generalisation to maintain the type variable naming conventions.)

Unifying in this way returns the type in the substitution, for example $M({}, 3, t0) = unify(Int, t0) = { t0: Int }$ and $M({ odd: Int \rightarrow Bool }, odd, t0 \rightarrow t1) = unify(Int \rightarrow Bool, t0 \rightarrow t1) = { t0: Int, t1: Bool }$, which is passed back up the tree.</span></p><p class="c0 c6"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Rule (4app) shows function application in M has no unification step. Instead, M is simply called recursively for each expression. The first expression, $e_1$, is expected to be a function taking a new type variable $tn$ and returning the expected type $\tau_e$ for the overall application. The second expression should have the argument type for the function, $tn$, after applying substitution $S_1$ to collect type constraints.</span></p><p class="c0 c6"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">For example, consider `odd 3` in the context $\Gamma = { odd: Int \rightarrow Bool }$ with expected type $t0$.

We then call M with the expected type $S_1(t1) = Int$ on `3`, which is validated and returns an empty substitution $S_2 = {}$.

This gives a substitution mapping the variables $t1$ and $t2$ to the expected function types, if any. This is applied to the context, along with adding the parameter $x$&rsquo;s type as $t1$. We then use M to infer the type of the function body, expecting it to have the unified return type $t2$. We return the combined substitution from both parts.</span></p><p class="c0 c6"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">For an example we look at applying M on `\x \rightarrow odd x` with $\Gamma = { odd: Int \rightarrow Bool }$ and expected type $t0$. We first unify $t0$ with the new type $t1 \rightarrow t2$, resulting in $S_1 = { t0: t1 \rightarrow t2 }$. We then make the recursive call to M with the function body `odd x`, context ${ odd: Int \rightarrow Bool, x: t1 }$ and expected type $t2$. This results in the substitution $S_2 = { t1: Int, t2: Bool }$, which we combine with $S_1$ to get $combine(S_2, S_1) = { t0: Int \rightarrow Bool, t1: Int, t2: Bool }$. As in W&rsquo;s function application, the new type variables will be unused outside of this expression so we can equivalently exclude $t1$ and $t2$ from the substitution.</span></p><p class="c0 c6"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Finally, let expressions infer the type of their parameter $e_1$ with a new type, then infer the type of their body $e_2$ expecting it to have the overall expected type $\tau_e$. Similarly to function abstraction, the substitution from the parameter is passed when inferring the body, and combined with the body&rsquo;s substitution to give an overall result.</span></p><p class="c0 c6"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">These type inference algorithms do have limitations. They all sometimes produce poor type error messages; Algorithm W often detects errors late, highlighting too large of a subexpression to be useful and Algorithm M often detects too specific of a term without context as to what original definition it violates. Algorithm W has the left-to-right bias which Algorithm W&rsquo; attempts to correct for, however this can sometimes exacerbate the problem with highlighting large subexpressions. Poor error messages make it difficult for the programmer to understand how to fix the problem.</span></p><p class="c0 c6"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span>To improve error messaging, hybrid or constraint-based algorithms along with heuristics are often used in practice to provide more informative error messages. Reducing the size of the amount inferred at once can help make errors more precise. For example, Apple&rsquo;s Swift uses a bi-directional type inference algorithm on single statements (</span><sup><a href="#ftnt34" id="ftnt_ref34">[34]</a></sup><span class="c2">).</span></p><p class="c0 c6"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span>Additionally, despite not being required in all languages, explicit type annotations are often used to help identify errors earlier at locations which are easier to interpret (</span><sup><a href="#ftnt35" id="ftnt_ref35">[35]</a></sup><span>). This is especially common for function definitions or program entry points. This also effectively splits up the program into smaller parts which can be inferred against separately, improving performance and making type errors more precise. In some cases, type inference algorithms struggle with (directly or indirectly) recursively defined functions and type annotations can help define these types. Finally, changing a rigidly-typed interface also highlights potential breaking changes to libraries or helper functions. In this way type annotations act as documentation to future programmers using the code. Manually specified, more specific types may be an improvement over automatically inferred types as sometimes the most general type as worked out by a type inference algorithm may not clearly convey the intent of the programmer.</span></p><p class="c0 c6"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">TODO: (maybe?)

The current resources for learning about type inference can be generally categorised into three categories: programming language documentation, formal resources and informal resources. These resources were found by examining the pages returned by the first 5 pages of Google search on the query &lsquo;type inference&rsquo;. The following is a summary of what was found from reading these resources with the aim of determining their strengths and weaknesses.</span></p><p class="c0 c6"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Programming language documentation are pages written to explain how type inference works in a specific language, as part of that language&rsquo;s official documentation. For example, TypeScript, Java and Golang all have official websites where they discuss how type inference works in their language.</span></p><p class="c0 c6"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Formal resources include university lecture notes, papers on type inference or encyclopedias. The first two are often in PDF format or on archiving websites. Wikipedia and WikiWikiWeb are examples of the latter (while encyclopedias summarise the subject they are generally written formally, with a lot of mathematical notation hence fall in this category).</span></p><p class="c0 c6"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Informal resources include personal blog posts and online talk recordings. These are generally written by developers interested in programming language design or compiler development.</span></p><p class="c0 c6"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Each category of resource covers different aspects of type inference.</span></p><p class="c0 c6"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Formal resources generally cover the most generic and widely-applicable concepts in a succinct manner. They usually present type inference in the context of the Hindley-Milner system, or a related functional language such as ML or OCaml. Formal resources usually detail how type inference algorithms (usually algorithm W) go about determining types, and the specific rules of the type system they operate in. It is rare for them to discuss how type errors are treated or give examples of error cases.</span></p><p class="c0 c6"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span>Programming language documentation </span><span>covers</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;type inference in the context of a specific language, with all results inspected giving code examples along with text explaining what the code is doing. Generally this documentation explains the features of type inference present in the language, rather than the wider concepts, although does so in a directly-applicable way. Some languages also explain language-specific concepts in detail, such as how type inference works with Java&rsquo;s generics or TypeScript&rsquo;s functions. They are also tailored to how languages are used, with Java&rsquo;s documentation exploring how type inference is applied in object-oriented programming and TypeScript giving examples of type inference with web APIs. They often do not discuss how the type inference algorithms determine the types, but rather just what the types are and roughly the rules of the type system. However, they do usually give sufficient examples to understand the type system, with languages such as TypeScript, Java and Scala including error cases and explanations on how to fix the type errors. These error examples are particularly helpful as they show how a programmer might go about debugging and fixing type errors found in their program.</span></p><p class="c0 c6"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span>Informal resources generally </span><span>discusses</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;personal reflections on what the author has learnt about type inference or they heavily focus on type inference&rsquo;s application within a specific language the author is familiar with. These are generally the least widely-applicable, and often only cover a small part of a single programming language, however do so in great detail and often giving practical advice about work related to their subject matter.</span></p><p class="c0 c6"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Resources also differ in accessibility: how easy it is for a user to read, understand and apply their content.</span></p><p class="c0 c6"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Programming language documentation and informal resources both are generally aimed at a more clearly targeted audience, usually programmers using a specific language. They are written in simpler language and use significantly less notation than formal resources which makes them easier reading. Their use of examples makes concepts clearer, and many of them have a level of interactivity which allows readers to try things for themselves, allowing readers to test their own knowledge or verify something that isn&rsquo;t clear to them from the documentation alone. For example TypeScript&rsquo;s documentation allows users to hover over code samples to inspect the types as well as open it up in an online coding environment, while Golang and Rust&rsquo;s respective documentation sites have example programs which users are encouraged to edit and run online. Blog posts often have code snippets or GitHub gists for users to run, and in talks presenters may give live coding demos, which serve similar purposes.</span></p><p class="c0 c6"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 601.70px; height: 382.67px;"><img alt="The TypeScript playground, with an example opened from the Type Inferece documentation showing how JavaScript classes can work in TypeScript." src="images/image5.png" style="width: 601.70px; height: 382.67px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c0 c6"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 601.70px; height: 382.67px;"><img alt="Golang&#39;s limited type inference is explained in &#39;A Tour of Go&#39;, with an example program the user is prompted to edit and run." src="images/image2.png" style="width: 601.70px; height: 382.67px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c0 c6"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 601.70px; height: 488.00px;"><img alt="Rust&#39;s page on type inference is short, but has a well-commented and insightful example that can be run and edited inline in the browser." src="images/image12.png" style="width: 601.70px; height: 488.00px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c0 c6"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span>Formal resources are usually aimed at a more mathematically-inclined audience, with less specific focus on any language or technology. It often uses mathematical terms and notation to convey ideas, which some readers may find difficult to understand. In particular, papers are often written in a very precise and succinct way with few examples, which can make them hard to interpret. This is likely due to the length constraints put in place by academic journals which incentives authors to cut more detailed explanations and examples from their work. Few papers and lecture notes would be immediately accessible to the general computer scientist, as papers often assume the reader has a strong grounding in the field already and lecture nodes are meant to be read in order, expecting the reader to have read the previous 20 lectures worth of notes. However, they do usually give clear and useful references for background and further reading which is useful for in-depth research on the topic, if not for an introduction. The implementation of a type inference algorithm and how it is applied to a specific language is rarely discussed. Where it is discussed the only languages used were Haskell, ML and OCaml. According to the StackOverflow Developers Survey</span><sup><a href="#ftnt36" id="ftnt_ref36">[36]</a></sup><span class="c2">&nbsp;Haskell is used by 1.8% of professional developers, while ML and OCaml are very rarely used in practice. These examples may therefore be of limited use to explain to developers how type inference is used in languages they are familiar with.</span></p><p class="c0 c6"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0 c6"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0 c6"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Finally, the different nature of resources means some are harder to correct or update with new information.</span></p><p class="c0 c6"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Informal resources generally seem to have the most errors, likely because it has little review process and may be written by anyone. Sometimes through comments other readers can provide corrections or clarifications, but these are not always incorporated into the material. However, commenting is not always available and also given the specific nature of some content few people are likely to view and suggest corrections to the content. Additionally, as informal resources are usually published as one-off talks or blog posts, it is rare for the document to be maintained and kept updated which can lead to inaccuracies if the underlying technology they are discussing has made breaking changes to its implementation.</span></p><p class="c0 c6"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Programming language documentation on type inference is generally accurate and well maintained. It is kept up to date with changes to the language, as usually there is a requirement to keep documentation updated in programming language projects. Additionally, almost all programming languages are open source and welcome external contributions to their documentation so readers are able to suggest improvements or raise issues about inaccuracies. Generally there is a review process, often requiring a maintainer of the programming language to approve the changes before edits are made.</span></p><p class="c0 c6"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Formal resources generally have few errors. For academic papers, this is likely a result of the peer-review process. Lecture notes are generally written by academics with relevant qualifications and educational backgrounds, who are likely to be knowledgeable on the subject. However, academic papers and lecture notes are unlikely to be updated, which means any inaccuracies in them are harder to correct. Exploring the literature we find there are some papers on type inference with errors which make understanding them fully more difficult. Finally, online encyclopedias can be reviewed and edited by many people, whose combined expertise generally results in accurate articles although they are prone to errors being introduced by even just a single contributor if they lack a review process. Luckily, except for errors, formal resources are unlikely to become outdated with time as much as informal resources. This is because formal resources focus on the more general underlying concepts over discussion on a specific implementation.</span></p><p class="c0 c6"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">This exploration into existing teaching resources is summarised in the table:</span></p><p class="c0 c6"><span class="c2"></span></p><a id="t.c414d112db19a40ea1a03ef46c2ea1ce80a4cd54"></a><a id="t.0"></a><table class="c23"><tbody><tr class="c20"><td class="c10" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c4 c6"><span class="c2"></span></p></td><td class="c10" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c4"><span class="c21">Content</span></p></td><td class="c10" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c4"><span class="c21">Accessibility</span></p></td><td class="c10" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c4"><span class="c21">Correctness</span></p></td></tr><tr class="c20"><td class="c10" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c4"><span class="c21">Programming language documentation</span></p></td><td class="c10" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c4"><span class="c2">Explains how type inference is applied in the context of a specific programming language including error cases.</span></p></td><td class="c10" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c4"><span class="c2">Written in plain language with code samples and often interactive environments.</span></p></td><td class="c10" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c4"><span class="c2">Few errors, and generally well-maintained.

Given that this project is a one-off piece of work and the end product may not be maintained indefinitely, research into the content, correctness and longevity of resources suggests that the focus should be on the more general type inference concepts rather than specific programming language features. The tool should support error cases, not just correctly-typed expressions. It should be reviewed by my project supervisor tested with users to identify errors that can be resolved before project completion. To aid accessibility text should be written in plain language, the tool should offer several insightful examples and the output should avoid overuse of complex notation.</span></p><p class="c0 c6"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">As a tool that displays the output of type inference algorithms, to further determine the user interface for the output of the tool the presentation of type inference proofs is examined. My supervisor initially gave some examples of worked proofs for type inference, which also matched the format of proofs found in papers and in online resources. These proofs are broken down into steps, which each look at a particular subexpression and apply a certain typing rule. Depending on the type of proof (whether it is based purely on the typing rules or is more procedural and similar to an algorithm), this may also result in explicit unification resulting in a substitution to be applied.</span></p><p class="c0 c6"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Based on this, the tool is designed to show the result of type inference on an expression broken into steps. Given that the tool will be automated, the steps must be generated based on some deterministic procedure and so the steps will correspond to those of the type inference algorithms. This means the steps will need to show the unification operations performed and the resultant substitutions to fully explain how the types are being inferred.</span></p><p class="c0 c6"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">A basic UI mockup is shown below that takes an input expression and displays the inference algorithm steps beneath it.

It was also at this design that it was decided to show the type derivation feedback instantly on the same page, based on the limitations of previous related work and the strength of interactive playgrounds in programming language documentation. On top of this design, the final application adds a choice of algorithms, several samples to choose from and a display of the final type. In addition, the final application shows and explains the steps of the type inference algorithm when type errors are present.</span></p><p class="c0 c6"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c5"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 453.58px; height: 493.50px;"><img alt="Recreation of an initial sketch of the UI for the teaching tool." src="images/image10.png" style="width: 453.58px; height: 493.50px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c0 c6"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">A step in the UI generally corresponds to a rule of the type inference algorithm.

This helps ensure the ordering of the steps makes logical sense.</span></p><p class="c0 c6"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">For example, this happens with function abstraction in algorithm W: the before step shows assigning a new type variable as the parameter&rsquo;s type, steps between show the results of the recursive call to the body, while the after step details the final type of the function abstraction expression.</span></p><p class="c0 c6"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c5"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 567.24px; height: 383.50px;"><img alt="Function abstraction in algorithm W requires two UI steps to represent one rule of the algorithm" src="images/image8.png" style="width: 567.24px; height: 383.50px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c0 c6"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">In addition to the rule steps, algorithm M requires an extra beginning and end step.
